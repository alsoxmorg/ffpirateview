.SH NAME
1fpirate \- a simple, lossless 1-bit image format based on farbfeld

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 1fpirate

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B 1fpirate
format is a minimal, uncompressed 1-bit per pixel raster image format. It is structurally similar to
.BR farbfeld (5),
but uses a single bit to represent each pixel. It is designed for scanned documents, manga, pixel art, and monochrome graphics.

All integers are stored in big-endian byte order.

.SH FILE FORMAT
A
.B 1fpirate
file consists of:

.TP
.B Bytes 0-7
The ASCII string
.BR "1fpirate"
(this is the magic number).

.TP
.B Bytes 8-11
Image width in pixels (unsigned 32-bit integer, big-endian)

.TP
.B Bytes 12-15
Image height in pixels (unsigned 32-bit integer, big-endian)

.TP
.B Bytes 16...
Image pixel data, stored as 1 bit per pixel, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
Each row is padded to the next byte boundary.

Each bit represents one pixel:
.IP
0 = white, 1 = black

Bits are packed MSB first (bit 7 is leftmost pixel of the byte).

.SH EXAMPLES
Write a 1fpirate file manually for a 16x16 checkerboard:
.IP
Use 16 (width) and 16 (height), and write 32 bytes of pattern data (16 rows Ã— 2 bytes/row).

.IP
To decode:
.RS
.br
Read the magic, dimensions, and unpack the bits row-wise.
.br
Convert each bit to either black (1) or white (0).
