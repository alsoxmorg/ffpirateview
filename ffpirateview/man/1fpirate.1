.TH 1FPIRATE 1 "May 2025" "1fpirate" "1fpirate image format"

.SH NAME
1fpirate \- A minimalist 1-bit image format for line art and monochrome graphics

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 1fpirate
[\fIFILE.1f\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B 1fpirate
is a simple 1-bit-per-pixel raster image format derived from farbfeld,
designed for high-contrast, monochrome images such as scanned
documents, technical drawings, manga-style comics, and coloring book
pages.

It is optimized for images where full color is unnecessary, enabling
high compression and fast streaming. A growing collection of tools
supports conversion from standard formats, including streaming
downscalers and a GIMP plugin for both loading and exporting
`.1f`/`.1ff` files.
